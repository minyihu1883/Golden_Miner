# Golden Miner
Golden Miner is a fun and exciting arcade-style game where you play as a miner, trying to collect as much gold and other valuable items as possible. The game includes six different item types, including Gold, Mini Gold, Rock, Diamond, Bomb, and Extra Life. The goal of the game is to collect as many items as possible while avoiding bombs, and to meet or exceed the level's score goal.

# Installation and Usage
To run Golden Miner, please ensure that you have both the "src" and "bin" folders in the same directory. Additionally, ensure that you have Eclipse configured to run JavaSE-18. Once you have these prerequisites, simply run the MainClass.java file to begin playing the game.

To play the game, use the down arrow key to control the miner and collect items. The different item types have different values, with Gold being worth $1000, Diamond being worth $1200, Rock being worth $250, and Mini Gold being worth $500. Bomb items should be avoided as they will cause a splash and end the game.

If you collect enough points to meet or exceed the level's score goal, you will advance to the shop where you can purchase upgrades. If you fail to meet the goal, the game will end.
